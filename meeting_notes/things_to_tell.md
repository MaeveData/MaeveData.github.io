### Things I've found out this week

#### 8 July 2023

I really need to keep better track of my learning, so I'll attempt to keep some notes in here.  I'm sure I'll modify things as I go, but this is a start.

This is most of what I looked into today.  I got the random user generator API from my course, then went down a rabbit hole trying to get a better way to keep some notes.

-  [Random user generator API](https://randomuser.me/)
- How to create GitHub Pages site and integrate with Jekyll
- How to use GitHub on my iPad 
  - lg2 command
  - alias git='lg2'
