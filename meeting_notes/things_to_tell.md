- if you create a pandas dataframe and it contains a nested json, you can create 
  multiple columns using df.json_
  - In this example, a df made from results had a column which had a dictionary=:
    ```data = requests.get(some_url)
    results = json.loads(data.text)
    df2 = pd.json_normalize(results)```

This is most of what I looked into today.  I got the random user generator API from my course, then went down a rabbit hole trying to get a better way to keep some notes.
